% Several people have wanted to have drill-aid style functions available
% when in the CAM process (drill-aid.ulp is a utility that fills in MOST
% of the hold area of pads/etc so that the hole in the copper left by
% photo or hobbyist plotting/etching techniques acts as a pilot hole for
% drills, rather than matching the full size of the drill.)  This is very
% handy for manual or non-CNC drilling.
% However, this has not worked from the CAM processor; only via PRINTing,
% which has assorted drawbacks if you're going to do further processing of
% the output files.  :-(
% 
% You CAN acheive drill-aid style processing via the CAM processor, at
% least for postscript and embedded-postscript if you define a couple
%  of new output devices that constrain the size of the "holes" they print.
% Use something like the following text added to eagle.def after you've
% changed the "5000" to whatever you prefer for the shrunken hole size
% (in 1/10000 mms, so 5000 = 0.5mm, etc)
